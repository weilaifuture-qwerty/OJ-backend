## üìù Integration Instructions

### 1. Add URL Patterns

Add to `problem/urls/oj.py`:
```python
from problem.views.oj_additions import (
    DailyProblemSuggestionAPI, ProblemSuggestionsAPI
)
from problem.views.oj_batch_status import BatchProblemStatusAPI

urlpatterns = [
    # ... existing patterns ...
    path("daily-suggestion/", DailyProblemSuggestionAPI.as_view(), name="daily_problem_suggestion"),
    path("suggestions/", ProblemSuggestionsAPI.as_view(), name="problem_suggestions"),
    path("check-status/", BatchProblemStatusAPI.as_view(), name="batch_problem_status"),
]
```

Add to `account/urls/oj.py`:
```python
from account.views.oj_additions import (
    UserStreakAPI, DailyCheckInAPI, UserPracticeStatsAPI
)

urlpatterns = [
    # ... existing patterns ...
    path("user/streak/", UserStreakAPI.as_view(), name="user_streak"),
    path("user/daily-check-in/", DailyCheckInAPI.as_view(), name="daily_check_in"),
    path("user/practice-stats/", UserPracticeStatsAPI.as_view(), name="practice_stats"),
]
```

Add to `homework/urls/oj.py`:
```python
from homework.views.oj_additions import (
    HomeworkProblemStatusAPI, HomeworkCommentsListAPI,
    HomeworkCommentCreateAPI, HomeworkCommentDeleteAPI
)
from homework.views.oj_improved import (
    StudentHomeworkListImprovedAPI, StudentHomeworkDetailImprovedAPI
)

urlpatterns = [
    # ... existing patterns ...
    # New improved endpoints
    path("homework/list/", StudentHomeworkListImprovedAPI.as_view(), name="homework_list_improved"),
    re_path(r"^homework/(?P<homework_id>\d+)/?$", StudentHomeworkDetailImprovedAPI.as_view(), name="homework_detail_improved"),
    
    # Comments
    re_path(r"^homework/(?P<homework_id>\d+)/comments/?$", HomeworkCommentsListAPI.as_view(), name="homework_comments_list"),
    re_path(r"^homework/(?P<homework_id>\d+)/comments/create/?$", HomeworkCommentCreateAPI.as_view(), name="homework_comment_create"),
    re_path(r"^homework/(?P<homework_id>\d+)/comments/(?P<comment_id>\d+)/?$", HomeworkCommentDeleteAPI.as_view(), name="homework_comment_delete"),
    
    # Problem status
    re_path(r"^homework/(?P<homework_id>\d+)/problem-status/?$", HomeworkProblemStatusAPI.as_view(), name="homework_problem_status"),
]
```

### 2. Run Migrations

Create and apply migrations for new models:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 3. Update Settings

Ensure signals are loaded by adding to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... other apps ...
    'submission.apps.SubmissionConfig',  # Use config instead of just 'submission'
]
```

## üéØ Key Features

1. **Real-time Status Tracking**: All homework and problem statuses are based on actual OJ submissions, not just database records.

2. **Automatic Updates**: When a student submits an accepted solution, homework status and scores are automatically updated.

3. **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Problems are recommended based on user's solving history, preferred tags, and skill level.

4. **Daily Challenges**: Users get personalized daily problems to maintain their streak.

5. **Efficient Batch Operations**: Check status of multiple problems in a single API call.

## üîß Testing

Test the endpoints:
```bash
# Daily suggestion
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/problem/daily-suggestion/

# User streak
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/user/streak/

# Batch status check
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"problem_ids": [1, 2, 3]}' \
  http://localhost:8000/api/problems/check-status/
```
